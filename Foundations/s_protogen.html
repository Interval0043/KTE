  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p><b>Maintainer: Engineer</b></p>
  <p>A protogen is a type of entity that can range from a cyborg, to fully robotic, having a very distinct visor that extends outward on their face and is shaped like a shark's head usually.</p>
  <p>This visor appears to be a screen, however it is really nanites that give the appearance of a screen while being able to open and close at the mouth.</p>
  <p>Other than that, all protogens are built off of bases of pre-existing animals, but are made anthropomorphic, including but not limited to walking canines or felines.</p>
