    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><b>Maintainer: Interval</b></p>
    <p>Limits are like the laws of everything; they are to always be followed.</p>
    <p>Since the laws of physics don't exist anywhere, we have these instead.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Limit 1</h2>
    <p>Summary: Nothing is more certain than change.</p>
    <p>To be more precist, absolutes quite often do not exist.</p>
    <p>Things always change, they are not guaranteed to be the same.</p>
    <p>Exceptions are few, this limit is an exception to itself, and the ODR is a known exception. But others should not exist.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Limit 2</h2>
    <p>Summary: Of you, there are 3. You, δ you, and φ you.</p>
    <p>Each thing to exist has two counterparts, one in the hypercomplex space, and the other in otherside.</p>
    <p>If one dies, all of them die. And no, they don't just spontaneously combust.</p>
    <p>It's convenient, that if one dies, both others will be in a situation of guaranteed death as well.</p>
    <p>Hypercomplex characters are prefixed with "δ", otherside characters are prefixed with "φ".</p>
