  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>KTE is, as you may have heard, a sort of open-ended RP server.</p>
  <p>The entire thing behind it, is that you can do whatever you want, within reason of course.</p>
  <p>Combat, hanging out, anything you can think of, you can make happen.</p>
  <p>We do have rules in place, but that's alright. Just follow them, we don't ask much.</p>
  <p>By the way, all of this is done with manual HTML, and GitHub Pages.</p>

  <h2>A few extra things</h2>
  <p>Species information is under foundations.</p>
  <p>OC information is under their owner's page, if it's here. If not, check discord.</p>
  <p>Foundations also contains a lot of useful theoretical information, you might need it.</p>
