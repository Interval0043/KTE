<h2>RP Sample</h2>
<blockquote>
  <i>
    Birds are Chirping all Around, Waterfalls were Flowing
    <br><br>
    You walk around to his Altar, You Tap the Middle of it and a Symbol of Wind appears
    <br>
    You Call out his Name.. "Aether I call for your Help."
    <br><br>
    The Birds Stop Chirping, and a Soft Humming was heard as the Image of Aether Appeared
    <br>
    You had an urge to... sing?
  </i>
  <br><br>
  <b>
    "Welcome Welcome Mortal oh Friend!"
    <br>
    "I am the Wind! Twisting and Turning!"
    <br>
    "I Give the Fire Enough to Stay Burning!"
    <br>
    "Let's Play My Game!"
    <br>
  </b>
  <br><br>
  <i>
    "A Game?"
  </i>
  <br><br>
  <b>
    Yes!, That's What Im Serving!"
    <br>
    "And If you win you will get what you're yearning"
  </b>
  <br><br>
  <i>
    "Deal!"
    <br><br>
    The Sudden Surge of Birds Chirping Spiked up and the Soft Humming Grew Louder
  </i>
  <br><br>
  <b>
    "Take a look right here as this bag!"
    <br>
    "It has the winds of the Storm all Trapped!"

    <br>
    "To Aid your trip home and get there all fast!"
